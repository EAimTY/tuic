# TUIC

Delicately-TUICed high-performance proxy built on top of the [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) protocol

**TUIC's goal is to minimize the handshake latency as much as possible**

## Features

- 1-RTT TCP relaying
- 0-RTT UDP relaying with [Full Cone NAT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3489#section-5)
- Two UDP relay modes: `native` (native UDP mechanisms) and `quic` (100% delivery rate)
- Bidirectional user-space congestion control (BBR, New Reno and CUBIC)
- Multiplexing all tasks into a single QUIC connection (tasks are separately flow controlled)
- Smooth session transfer on network switching
- Paralleled 0-RTT authentication
- Optional QUIC 0-RTT handshake

## Design

TUIC was designed on the basis of the QUIC protocol from the very beginning. It can make full use of the advantages brought by QUIC. You can find more information about the TUIC protocol [here](https://github.com/EAimTY/tuic/tree/master/protocol).

### Multiplexing

TUIC multiplexes all tasks into a single QUIC connection using QUIC's multi-streams mechanism. This means that unless the QUIC connection is forcibly interrupted or no task within the maximum idle time, negotiating new relay task does not need to go through the process of QUIC handshake and TUIC authentication.

### UDP Relaying

TUIC has 2 UDP relay modes:

- `native` - using QUIC's datagram to transmit UDP packets. As with native UDP, packets may be lost, but the overhead of the acknowledgment mechanism is omitted. Relayed packets are still encrypted by QUIC.

- `quic` - transporting UDP packets as QUIC streams. Because of the acknowledgment and retransmission mechanism, UDP packets can guarantee a 100% delivery rate, but have additional transmission overhead as a result. Note that each UDP data packet is transmitted as a separate stream, and the flow controlled separately, so the loss and retransmission of one packet will not cause other packets to be blocked. This mode can be used to transmit UDP packets larger than the MTU of the underlying network.

### Bidirectional User-space Congestion Control

Since QUIC is implemented over UDP, its congestion control implementation is not limited by platform and operating system. For poor quality network, [BBR algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control#TCP_BBR) can be used on both the server and the client to achieve better transmission performance.

### Security

As mentioned above, TUIC is based on the QUIC protocol, which uses TLS to encrypt data. TUIC protocol itself does not provide any security, but the QUIC protocol provides a strong security guarantee. TUIC also supports QUIC's 0-RTT handshake, but it came with a cost of weakened security, [read more about QUIC 0-RTT handshake](https://blog.cloudflare.com/even-faster-connection-establishment-with-quic-0-rtt-resumption/#attack-of-the-clones).

## Usage

TUIC depends on [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls), which uses [ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring) for implementing the cryptography in TLS. As a result, TUIC only runs on platforms supported by ring. At the time of writing this means x86, x86-64, armv7, and aarch64.

You can find pre-compiled binaries in the latest [releases](https://github.com/EAimTY/tuic/releases).

## FAQ

### What are the advantages of TUIC over other proxy protocols / implementions?

As mentioned before, TUIC's goal is to minimize the handshake latency as much as possible. Thus, the core of the TUIC protocol is to reduce the additional round trip time added by the relay. For TCP relaying, TUIC only adds a single round trip between the TUIC server and the TUIC client - half of a typical TCP-based proxy would require. TUIC also has a unique UDP relaying mechanism. It achieves 0-RTT UDP relaying by syncing UDP relay sessions implicitly between the server and the client.

Low handshake latency means faster connection establishment and UDP packet delay time. TUIC also supports both UDP over streams and UDP over datagrams for UDP relaying. All of these makes TUIC one of the most efficient proxy protocol for UDP relaying.

### Why my TUIC is slower than other proxy protocols / implementions?

For an Internet connection, fast / slow is defined by both:

- Handshake latency
- Bandwidth

They are equally important. For the first case, TUIC can be one of the best solution right now. You can directly feel it from things like the speed of opening a web page in your browser. For the second case, TUIC may be a bit slower than other TCP-based proxy protocols due to ISPs' QoS, but TUIC's bandwidth can still be competitive in most scenario.

### How can I listen both IPv4 and IPv6 on TUIC server / TUIC client's socks5 server?

TUIC always constructs an IPv6 listener as a dual-stack socket. If you need to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6, you can set the bind IP to the unspecified IPv6 address `::`.

### Why TUIC client doesn't support other inbound / advanced route settings?

Since there are already many great proxy convert / distribute solutions, there really is no need for me to reimplement those again. If you need those functions, the best choice to chain a V2Ray layer in front of the TUIC client. For a typical network program, there is basically no performance cost for local relaying.
